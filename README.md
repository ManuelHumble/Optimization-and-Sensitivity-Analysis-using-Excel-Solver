## ðŸ“˜ Project Overview

This project demonstrates how **Excel Solver** can be used to optimize production planning decisions by minimizing total cost while satisfying demand and resource constraints. It also includes a **sensitivity analysis** to explore how parameter changes (like resource availability or product demand) affect optimal results.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

To identify the most cost-effective production combination across multiple product types and evaluate how sensitive the solution is to variations in input values.
